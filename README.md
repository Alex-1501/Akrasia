## Akrasia

This is a project aimed to enhance my python skills, specifically with the use of socket and threading.
- By the end Akrasia should be a functional C2 server that can be used on a local network.

### ToDo:
- ~~Implement Return Statement Into Functions Instead Of Directly Printing It Out~~
- ~~Fix Issue With ActiveClients() Only Returning The First Item (HIGH PRIORITY)~~
- Make Code Readable (HIGH PRIORITY (In-Progress)
- ~~Add A Way To Issue Commands~~
- ~~Allow for clients to be gracefully dropped~~
- Allow for client.py to automatically be adjusted to server's IP and Port (?) (LOW)
- Allow for payloads to be sent (LOW)
-
