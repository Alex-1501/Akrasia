## Akrasia

This is a project aimed to enhance my python skills, specifically with the use of socket and threading.
- By the end Akrasia should be a functional C2 server that can be used on a local network.

### ToDo:
- Implement Return Statement Into Functions Instead Of Directly Printing It Out
- Improve Menu Loop
